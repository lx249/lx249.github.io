I am currently an **Assistant Research Professor** (Senior Research Associate) at the [Supply Chain AI Lab (SCAIL)](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/supply-chain-ai-lab/), Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge.

My research focuses on **multi-agent systems, agentic AI, and their applications in supply chain management and logistics**. I formally conceptualised [autonomous supply chains (ASCs)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452414X24001419) and proposed a multi-agent framework for their implementation. I am particularly interested in the *architectural* and *interaction* aspects of scalable multi-agent systems in decentralised settings such as supply chain networks.  

More recently, my work has explored the integration of **large language models (LLMs)** with traditional multi-agent systems---so-called *agentic systems*---as well as with **knowledge graphs** for automated, privacy-preserving knowledge aggregation. 
*This integration is a key step towards realising fully autonomous supply chains*.

Previously, I completed my **PhD at the University of Nottingham** in 2019, where I worked on the interdisciplinary topic of *Artcode Detection*, which span computer vision, human-computer interaction, and graphic design, under the supervision of [Steve Benford](https://stevebenford.com/biography/), [Andrew P. French](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=SESz4-UAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Dave Towey](https://research.nottingham.edu.cn/en/persons/dave-towey).  

Beyond academia, I am also a **full-stack developer and system architect**, with experience in designing and building diverse systems across B/S, P2P, microservices, layered, and event-driven architectures.
