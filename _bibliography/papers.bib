  title         = {Fair Collaborative Vehicle Routing: A Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach},
  author        = {Mak, Stephen and Xu, Liming and Pearce, Tim and Ostroumov, Michael and Brintrup, Alexandra},
  abstract      = {Collaborative vehicle routing occurs when carriers collaborate through sharing their transportation requests and performing transportation requests on behalf of each other. This achieves economies of scale, thus reducing cost, greenhouse gas emissions and road congestion. But which carrier should partner with whom, and how much should each carrier be compensated? Traditional game theoretic solution concepts are expensive to calculate as the characteristic function scales exponentially with the number of agents. This would require solving the vehicle routing problem (NP-hard) an exponential number of times. We therefore propose to model this problem as a coalitional bargaining game solved using deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, where - crucially - agents are not given access to the characteristic function. Instead, we implicitly reason about the characteristic function; thus, when deployed in production, we only need to evaluate the expensive post-collaboration vehicle routing problem once. Our contribution is that we are the first to consider both the route allocation problem and gain sharing problem simultaneously - without access to the expensive characteristic function. Through decentralised machine learning, our agents bargain with each other and agree to outcomes that correlate well with the Shapley value - a fair profit allocation mechanism. Importantly, we are able to achieve a reduction in run-time of 88%.},

  author        = {Xu, Liming and Towey, Dave and French, Andrew P and Benford, Steve and Zhou, Zhi Quan and Chen, Tsong Yueh},
  abstract      = {Software testing is often hindered where it is impossible or impractical to determine the correctness of the behaviour or output of the software under test (SUT), a situation known as the oracle problem. An example of an area facing the oracle problem is automatic image classification, using machine learning to classify an input image as one of a set of predefined classes. An approach to software testing that alleviates the oracle problem is metamorphic testing (MT). While traditional software testing examines the correctness of individual test cases, MT instead examines the relations amongst multiple executions of test cases and their outputs. These relations are called metamorphic relations (MRs): if an MR is found to be violated, then a fault must exist in the SUT. This paper examines the problem of classifying images containing visually hidden markers called Artcodes, and applies MT to verify and enhance the trained classifiers. This paper further examines two MRs, Separation and Occlusion, and reports on their capability in verifying the image classification using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in conjunction with three other statistical analysis methods: t-test (for unequal variances), Kruskal-Wallis test, and Dunnett's test. In addition to our previously-studied classifier, that used Random Forests, we introduce a new classifier that uses a support vector machine, and present its MR-augmented version. Experimental evaluations across a number of performance metrics show that the augmented classifiers can achieve better performance than non-augmented classifiers. This paper also analyses how the enhanced performance is obtained.},

  title         = {Will Bots Take Over the Supply Chain? {Revisiting} Agent-based Supply Chain Automation},
  author        = {Xu, Liming and Mak, Stephen and Brintrup, Alexandra},
  abstract      = {Agent-based systems have the capability to fuse information from many distributed sources and create better plans faster. This feature makes agent-based systems naturally suitable to address the challenges in Supply Chain Management (SCM). Although agent-based supply chains systems have been proposed since early 2000; industrial uptake of them has been lagging. The reasons quoted include the immaturity of the technology, a lack of interoperability with supply chain information systems, and a lack of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we revisit the agent-based supply chain and review the state of the art. We find that agent-based technology has matured, and other supporting technologies that are penetrating supply chains; are filling in gaps, leaving the concept applicable to a wider range of functions. For example, the ubiquity of IoT technology helps agents "sense" the state of affairs in a supply chain and opens up new possibilities for automation. Digital ledgers help securely transfer data between third parties, making agent-based information sharing possible, without the need to integrate Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Learning functionality in agents enables agents to move beyond automation and towards autonomy. We note this convergence effect through conceptualising an agent-based supply chain framework, reviewing its components, and highlighting research challenges that need to be addressed in moving forward.},

  author        = {Long, Yunbo and Xu, Liming and Brintrup, Alexandra},
  abstract      = {Synthetic tabular data are increasingly being used to replace real data, serving as an effective solution that simultaneously protects privacy and addresses data scarcity. However, in addition to preserving global statistical properties, synthetic datasets must also maintain domain-specific logical consistency**-**especially in complex systems like supply chains, where fields such as shipment dates, locations, and product categories must remain logically consistent for real-world usability. Existing generative models often overlook these inter-column relationships, leading to unreliable synthetic tabular data in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-TabLogic, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Model reasoning to capture and compress the complex logical relationships among tabular columns, while these conditional constraints are passed into a Score-based Diffusion model for data generation in latent space. Through extensive experiments on real-world industrial datasets, we evaluate LLM-TabLogic for column reasoning and data generation, comparing it with five baselines including SMOTE and state-of-the-art generative models. Our results show that LLM-TabLogic demonstrates strong generalization in logical inference, achieving over 90% accuracy on unseen tables. Furthermore, our method outperforms all baselines in data generation by fully preserving inter-column relationships while maintaining the best balance between data fidelity, utility, and privacy. This study presents the first method to effectively preserve inter-column relationships in synthetic tabular data generation without requiring domain knowledge, offering new insights for creating logically consistent real-world tabular data.},

  abs           = {Graph distillation (GD) is an effective approach to extract useful information from large-scale network structures. However, existing methods, which operate in Euclidean space to generate condensed graphs, struggle to capture the inherent tree-like geometry of real-world networks, resulting in distilled graphs with limited task-specific information for downstream tasks. Furthermore, these methods often fail to extract dynamic properties from graphs, which are crucial for understanding information flow and facilitating graph continual learning. This paper presents the Hyperbolic Graph Distillation with Random Walks Optimization (HyDRO), a novel graph distillation approach that leverages hyperbolic embeddings to capture complex geometric patterns and optimize the spectral gap in hyperbolic space. Experiments show that HyDRO demonstrates strong task generalization, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both node classification and link prediction tasks. HyDRO also effectively preserves graph random walk properties, producing condensed graphs that achieve enhanced performance in continual graph learning. Additionally, HyDRO achieves competitive results on mainstream graph distillation benchmarks, while maintaining a strong balance between privacy and utility, and exhibiting robust resistance to noises.},

  abstract      = {Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex}, \textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.},

  author        = {Yunbo Long and Yuhan Liu and Liming Xu and Alexandra Brintrup},
  abstract      = {Large language model-based chatbots have enhanced engagement in financial negotiations, but their overreliance on passive empathy introduces critical risks in credit collection. While empathy-driven approaches preserve client satisfaction in benign cases, they fail catastrophically against dishonest debtors--individuals who exploit conciliatory tactics to manipulate terms or evade repayment. Blindly prioritizing "customer experience" in such scenarios leads to creditor vulnerabilities: revenue leakage, moral hazard, and systemic exploitation. To address this, we propose EQ-Knight, an LLM agent that dynamically optimizes emotional strategy to defend creditor interests. Unlike naive empathy-centric bots, EQ-Knight integrates emotion memory and game-theoretic reasoning, powered by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to track and predict debtor emotional states. By analyzing both real-time and historical emotional cues, EQ-Knight strategically counters negative emotions (e.g., aggression, feigned distress) while preserving productive debtor relationships. Experiments demonstrate EQ-Knight's superiority over conventional LLM negotiators: it achieves a 32\% reduction in concession losses without compromising recovery rates, particularly in adversarial cases where debtors weaponize negative emotions (e.g., intimidation, guilt-tripping) to coerce concessions. For credit agencies, EQ-Knight transforms LLMs from high-risk "people-pleasers" into strategic emotion-defenders--balancing emotional intelligence with tactical rigor to enforce accountability and deter exploitation.},

We present SynDelay, a synthetic dataset designed for delivery delay prediction. Generated using an advanced generative model trained on real-world data, SynDelay preserves realistic delivery patterns while ensuring privacy. Although not entirely free of noise or inconsistencies, it provides a challenging and practical testbed for advancing predictive modelling. To support adoption, we provide baseline results and evaluation metrics as initial benchmarks, serving as reference points rather than state-of-the-art claims. SynDelay is publicly available through the Supply Chain Data Hub, an open initiative promoting dataset sharing and benchmarking in supply chain AI. We encourage the community to contribute datasets, models, and evaluation practices to advance research in this area.},

  abstract      = {The recent Facebook rebranding to Meta has drawn renewed attention to the metaverse. Technology giants, amongst others, are increasingly embracing the vision and opportunities of a hybrid social experience that mixes physical and virtual interactions. As the metaverse gains in traction, it is expected that everyday objects may soon connect more closely with virtual elements. However, discovering this “hidden” virtual world will be a crucial first step to interacting with it in this new augmented world. In this paper, we address the problem of connecting phys-ical objects with their virtual counterparts, especially through connections built upon visual markers. We propose a unified recognition framework that guides approaches to the metaverse access points. We illustrate the use of the framework through experimental studies under different conditions, in which an interactive and visually attractive decoration pattern, an Artcode, is used as the approach to enable the connection. This paper will be of interest to, amongst others, researchers working in Interaction Design or Augmented Reality who are seeking techniques or guidelines for augmenting physical objects in an unobtrusive, complementary manner.},
