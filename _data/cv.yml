    - <u>Football</u> - 
      Since 2022, I have <strong>managed and captained</strong> an amateur football team, overseeing player recruitment, friendly matches, and overall operations.
      Under my leadership, the team achieved promotion to a higher division---an unprecedented milestone in its <strong>14-year</strong> history. 
      I also organise weekly football activities for the wider Cambridge Chinese community, engaging <strong>several hundred members</strong> over the past four years.
      I am <em>very proud</em> of these volunteer duties, which allow me to connect with a large network of football enthusiasts who work and study at Cambridge.
    - <u>Other interests</u> - 
      Cooking, Chinese Calligraphy, and Badminton.
      I enjoy experimenting with <strong>new recipes</strong> and sharing them with friends
      I also serve as the <em>de facto</em> organiser of social events within my current research group, having coordinated nearly all group dinners and farewell gatherings since the COVID-19 pandemic.
